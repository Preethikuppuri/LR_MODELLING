# LR Modelling  

This project demonstrates building and evaluating regression models to understand relationships between variables and make predictions.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
- Implementation of **Linear Regression** and/or **Logistic Regression**  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)  

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. Load dataset  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Preprocess data (handling missing values, feature scaling)  
4. Train regression models (Linear / Logistic)  
5. Evaluate with performance metrics  

## ðŸ”¹ Example Output
- Regression line fit on dataset  
- Accuracy scores for classification tasks  
- Error metrics (MAE, RMSE) for regression tasks
